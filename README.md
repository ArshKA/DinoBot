# DinoBot
Small code snippet to play the chrome dinosaur game (chrome://dino) decently well. Usually gets around 4000 but haven't done too much testing. If I'm bored I might decide to implement different jump heights based on cactus size, but feel free to add something.

# USE
Run the file, switch to dinogame tab within 2 seconds (or alter the switch time)

This was created on a 1080 x 1920 display. Any other size will require tweaking the pixel values.
