# DinoBot
Small python script to play the chrome dinosaur game (chrome://dino) decently well. Usually gets around 4000 but haven't done too much testing. If I'm bored I might decide to implement different jump heights based on cactus size to prevent getting "trapped" at higher speeds. Feel free to add any improvements.

## USE
Run the file, switch to dinogame tab within 2 seconds (or alter the switch time)

This was created on a 1080 x 1920 display. Any other size will require tweaking the pixel values.
